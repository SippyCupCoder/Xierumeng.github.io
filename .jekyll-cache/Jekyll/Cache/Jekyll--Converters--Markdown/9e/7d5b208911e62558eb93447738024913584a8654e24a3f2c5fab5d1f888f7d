<p>This is my website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my comics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PROJECTS - Link and description of various projects Iâ€™m currently working on.</li>
  <li>FIRST PAGE - First page of my comics.</li>
  <li>LAST PAGE - Last page of my comics.</li>
  <li>ARCHIVE - A list of all of my comics.</li>
  <li>ABOUT - Some information about myself.</li>
  <li>EXTRAS - Miscellaneous stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>I apologize in advance if this website is broken or something. Iâ€™m just starting to learn how to do this.
Also, I apologize if images are acting up; I also donâ€™t really know how to scale them nicely.
Feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io">Github</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my content!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Xierumeng</p>
