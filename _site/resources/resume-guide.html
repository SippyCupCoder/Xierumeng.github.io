    <h2>Xierumeng's Guide to R&eacute;sum&eacute; Creation</h2>
    <p>Note: With thanks to Gibstick and Mewtwo (UW alumni) as well as my Patrons.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I give résumé feedback I essentially re-iterate the following content. Also, remember that this is a guide, and everything I write here is only a suggestion. Your résumé is your résumé and you are free to accept or reject any suggestions/feedback.</p>

<h1 id="general">General</h1>

<p>These are the basics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An office. On a desk, a stack of résumés from hopeful applicants. The employer sitting behind said desk starts its work on screening potential interview candidates by picking up half the stack and tossing it into the recycling bin. “I don’t hire unlucky people,” it states, before looking over the first survivor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Employers will spend between 15 and 60 seconds looking at your résumé, looking at possibly hundreds of them over several days. Therefore, it is critical to convey your eligibility in this extremely short period by having a well-organized résumé.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Length - The length of your résumé should be at most one page. If you find yourself running out of space, you should remove content or re-arrange formatting and layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency - Inconsistent formatting will throw the employer off (e.g. if some points have periods at the end while others don’t).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professional - Your résumé should be professional. This means no spelling or grammar mistakes, no vulgarity, etc. It should not be in first person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Images - There should be no images (other than perhaps icons).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Columns - I prefer one column layouts over two column layouts, because when I look at two column layouts I’m not sure where to look which is very distracting. Automated scanning systems will also most likely screw up on two column layouts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Margins - I recommend margins of 15 mm to 25 mm. Gibstick recommends margins of at least 25 mm: “The majority of résumés I see have tiny ass margins that make it unreadable cause your eyes have to travel five miles across the page”. Just don’t make them too narrow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spacing - Make sure the spacing between lines is good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Separation - Make sure each section and sub-section are properly separated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placement - Order your sub-sections by importance, not chronologically. A good older project should be higher than a mediocre new project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="font">Font</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Type - I prefer sans-serif fonts because they have less clutter. You should avoid monospaced fonts or fonts that are similar to monospaced fonts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Size - Don’t make it too small.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Colour - Some colour adds personality to your résumé. However, make sure that it will appear alright if converted to greyscale (most likely through a printer). Also make sure colouring is consistent. I’m not a fan of multiple colours on a single line.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="header">Header</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some résumés have light text on dark background. I find it distracting as it makes the résumé feel “top-heavy”. Also RIP ink usage if it’s printed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Name - The name should be big and centred (maybe even bolded).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Year and program - Don’t bother as it’s redundant information. If you’re applying through Waterlooworksn’t, then the application package will have your year and program. If not, then your Education section will be first (as stated below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact and information - Icons can be used as separators and they look nicer than e.g. “Email:”. Make sure to hyperlink, but for the displayed text you can drop the protocol (“https://”) and “www” e.g. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin.com/</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Email - This should be your UW email, and should be “first.last@uwaterloo.ca” or something similar. You can set this in WatIAM.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Phone - Self-explanatory but not necessary. No hurt in including or excluding it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>GitHub - GitHub or another code hosting website is a great way of showcasing your projects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>LinkedIn - I never found a good use for LinkedIn other than an obligatory timeline of my life. I have it mainly because it’s generally expected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Website - If you have a website, it’s another great way of showcasing your projects. You can also add personal touches (such as hobbies) that would otherwise not be appropriate on GitHub or your résumé.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Address - Not needed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="sections">Sections</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Titles - The titles should be large enough that they are distinct from the sub-titles and body text, but not in a way where they completely overshadow the content (i.e. don’t make them too big). It should also be different (e.g. bold and/or uppercase). Horizontal lines/underlining can be used to help separation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Types - I recommend four sections. More detail in each one below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Skills - Rather than “Summary of Qualifications”. This should be at the top. Mewtwo writes to move this to the bottom “once u actually have experience”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Projects - Depending on your side projects vs work experience, either Projects or Experience should be before the other.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Experience - Rather than “Relevant Experience”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Education - If you’re applying through Waterlooworksn’t, this goes last. Otherwise first.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Awards/Achievements - If you’ve won any large awards (e.g. Loran) then it may be worthwhile to include them.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>This section should be a very brief summary of your familiarity with different tools, and basically is consisted of keywords.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Languages - Programming languages you are familiar with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tools - This could be “technologies” or “libraries” or “frameworks”; essentially all the tools you are familiar with (e.g. “Git”).
If you’re applying for jobs in the government or in a foreign country then it may be useful to list the relevant human languages you know (e.g. “French”). Mewtwo doesn’t think it will be though.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>This section contains any relevant work and volunteer experience. If you have no/very little relevant experience, add one or two irrelevant experiences in this section (something is better than nothing). This section should not be missing or empty.</p>

<h3 id="sub-sections">Sub-sections</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-titles - Name of company, position title, languages/tools used, location (optional). This can be two lines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dates - Include the start and end date (“present” if it is ongoing when you submit your résumé). I put the dates on the right margin. The format I use is “Abbreviated month year - Abbreviated month year” e.g. “Jan. 2005 - Dec. 2008”.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There are multiple ways of abbreviating the months: Jun. vs June, Jul. vs July, Sep. vs Sept. Just keep it consistent throughout e.g. if September is abbreviated to “Sept.” then abbreviate all instances in the same manner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Points - There should be two to five points in each sub-section. More detail about points below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>This section contains any side projects you’ve worked on in your free time. Make sure to include projects that have enough complexity to be interesting; they should be doing something.</p>

<p>Small high school/university assignments aren’t usually worth putting on your résumé unless you’ve extended them since submission or you have no other technical experience (something is better than nothing). Also be careful putting assignment code online, as the university may invoke policy 71 (academic integrity) on you.</p>

<h3 id="sub-sections-1">Sub-sections</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-titles - Name of the project, languages/tools used. This should be one line. You can also add a link to GitHub here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dates - I used to have dates and then I removed them because they weren’t important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Points - There should be two to five points in each sub-section. More detail about points below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>This section contains your education. Don’t bother including high school.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Name of school - “University of Waterloo”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Degree and program - If you don’t currently have a degree, you are not supposed to write it. However, you are working towards a degree, so prefixing with “Candidate for” is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dates - Include the start and end date. If you are still in the program, add “expected” to the end date which should still be in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Courses - You can put any course names you think are relevant (e.g. “Algorithms and Data Structures”). Don’t put course codes as employers won’t bother looking those up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>School awards - You can put any awards that you think are worthwhile. However, President’s Scholarship is one that you shouldn’t as pretty much everyone got it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="points">Points</h1>

<p>Points are the details that the employer will look at after the initial screening. Points should be concise and direct.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Action verb - Every point must begin with an action verb. Examples of good action verbs include “developed”, “designed”, “applied”, “modelled”, “enhanced”, “improved”, “documented”, “implemented”. Use strong action verbs over weaker ones (e.g. not “used”, “demonstrated”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What-How-Why/What-Why-How - Every point should have this model. Sometimes the How can be deferred to another point below.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>What - What did you do? What action did you take? What was implemented?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How - How did you do the action? Did you use any tools?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Why - Why did you take the action? What was the result/impact? What was the goal?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quantification - If at all possible, quantify the results/impact of your actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skill demonstration - The action/result/impact in a point should imply the demonstrated skill. The skill should not be explicitly stated nor a point started with one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sentence - Each point should be able to be a valid sentence when prefixed with a pronoun or name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Placement - Order your points from most important to least important. However, the first point could be a summary of what you did over the term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Length - Points should be able to fit on a single line. Very rarely would a point occupy two lines. Five is right out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-1">Example 1</h2>

<p><em>Implemented a matrix solver with the [math] library to generate a correction from identified pixels in images</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Action verb - “Implemented”.</li>
  <li>What-How-Why.
    <ul>
      <li>What - “Implemented a matrix solver”.</li>
      <li>How - “with the [math] library”.</li>
      <li>Why - “to generate a correction …”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quantification - None.</li>
  <li>Skill demonstration.
    <ul>
      <li>Linear algebra - “matrix”.</li>
      <li>Usage of external tools - “[math] library”.</li>
      <li>Computer vision - “identified pixels in images”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>[Xierumeng] implemented a matrix solver ….</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Placement - N/A.</li>
  <li>Length - Fits on one line in my résumé.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>

<p><em>Wrote [#] unit tests in log collection bash scripts to validate regex scrubbing of personally identifiable information</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Action verb - “Wrote”. Personally I think it’s a bit weak.</li>
  <li>What-How-Why.
    <ul>
      <li>What - “Wrote [#] unit tests in log collection bash scripts”.</li>
      <li>How - “bash scripts”.</li>
      <li>Why - “to validate regex scrubbing …”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quantification - “[#] unit tests”.</li>
  <li>Skill demonstration.
    <ul>
      <li>Unit testing - “unit tests”.</li>
      <li>Bash scripting - “bash scripts”.</li>
      <li>Regular expressions - “regex scrubbing”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sentence
    <ul>
      <li>[Xierumeng] wrote [#] unit tests ….</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Placement - N/A.</li>
  <li>Length - Fits on one line in my résumé.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible improvement: <em>Validated regex scrubbing of personally identifiable information by writing [#] unit tests in log collection bash scripts</em></p>

<h2 id="example-3">Example 3</h2>

<p><em>Demonstrated knowledge of physics engines by implementing semi-implicit Euler integration math and quaternions for rotation to simulate ship movement</em></p>

<p>The action verb is weak, and by explicitly stating the skill, the more interesting part of the point is moved into the passive voice. A better point would be:</p>

<p><em>Developed a physics engine using semi-implicit Euler integration math and quaternions for rotation to simulate ship movement</em></p>

<p>The action verb is better and the skill demonstrated has been improved (not only knowledge of, but how to implement a physics engine). Plus it’s more concise.</p>
