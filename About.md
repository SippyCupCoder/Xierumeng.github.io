# About

## Comic

It's not really a comic. More like dank memes about being an engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

## Blog

I am starting an introductory guide to the University of Waterloo, focused on my program. Also included will be resources such as my r&eacute;sum&eacute; guide.

## Author

Xierumeng enjoys butter tarts, explosions, and SPAAACE. Contrary to popular belief, I can't think in 7 dimensions.
