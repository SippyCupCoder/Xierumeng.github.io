This is part of a 4-part series on the first year experience at the University of Waterloo.

Today's topic will be on co-op. I will talk about CECA, WaterlooWorks (referred everywhere else in my site as WaterlooWorksn't), and applying for jobs.

The University of Waterloo has a strong co-op program because employers are interested in hiring UW students due to their reputation and because of the WaterlooWorks job board, which consolidates a large number of postings and allows students to apply with a few of the same clicks. However, just because you are in a co-op program does not guarantee you a job. You still have to do the work of making a good r&eacute;sum&eacute; and attending interviews.

# CECA

CECA has a bunch of acronyms and initialisms that constantly change, and I refuse to play along, so this is my name of the co-op administration. Like most administration at UW, CECA is generally competent when there are no special cases, exceptions, or urgency. CECA maintains WaterlooWorks, schedules interviews (and resolves conflicts), matches students to employers after rankings, nags students for (electronic) paperwork, and "resolves" student-employer disputes (most of the time in favour of the employer to the detriment of the student).

# Rounds

CECA maintains a schedule for the term, which contain all of the rounds. A round consists of:

* Employers posting jobs, students applying for jobs.
* Employers reviewing r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and running interviews.
* Employers ranking students.
* Students ranking employers.
* Employer-student matching.

## Rankings and Matching

Rankings are from 1 to 10 inclusive, lower is better. When an employer ranks a student a 1, it shows up on WaterlooWorks as "Offer". 2 to 10 inclusive shows up as "Ranked", and if the employer doesn't want to hire the student at all, it shows up as "Not Ranked". Employers have the ability to rank multiple students the same number.

Once employer rankings are done, students rank employers. You are also allowed to rank multiple employers the same number (so if you really want to play it safe you can rank 1 for everything - assuming any employers ranked you). You also have three "Not Interested" rankings for the entire term, because even if you rank a job a 10, you still might be matched with it.

Matches are then made through some magic algorithm that still isn't very clear on how it works (and CECA wants to keep it that way to prevent students from gaming the system, which I think doesn't help and actively stresses students out). I speculate that it goes down by job posting. What is public is that the employer rankings and the student rankings are added, and lowest sum wins (ties are determined randomly). Once you are matched, you are taken out of the applicant pool and that is your co-op for next term. Ranking an Offer a 1 is a guaranteed match.

CECA says you're not supposed to contact employers about rankings. Of course, I have not heard of any cases where a student has been *caught* doing this. Employers are generally don't want to do any more admin work than necessary.

### Match Examples

WIP.

Offer-1:

|           | Employer 1 | Student | Total |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Student A | 1 (offer)  | 1       | 2     |
| Student B | 2 (ranked) | 1       | 3     |

Student A is matched to Employer 1.

Offer-2:

|           | Employer 1 | Student | Total |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Student A | 1 (offer)  | 2       | 3     |
| Student B | 2 (ranked) | 1       | 3     |

Either Student A or Student B is matched to Employer 1.

Getting wrecked by ties:

Let's say Student A really wanted Employer 2, but Employer 1 was their backup. Also, previously, Student B was matched with Employer 1.

|           | Employer 2 | Student | Total |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Student A | 2 (ranked) | 1       | 3     |
| Student C | 1 (offer)  | 2       | 3     |

Either Student A or Student C is matched to Employer 2. If Student C is matched to Employer 2, Student A is out of luck.

Worse, all Student A sees is "Ranked". So this might have been the scenario:

|           | Employer 2 | Student | Total |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Student A | 5 (ranked) | 1       | 6     |
| Student C | 1 (offer)  | 2       | 3     |

Have fun playing the lottery!

### Cancellation and Reneging

While employers have the luxury of cancelling jobs with virtually no consequences even after matching, a student that reneges on a match will be banned from WaterlooWorks for the next two co-op search terms (I'm not sure what happens for your last co-op search though). So make sure you use those "Not Interested" ranks if you interviewed and then realized the job was completely different from the posting description.

Of course, if you're confident you're able to get a job externally, then banning doesn't have much consequence.

# WaterlooWorks

WaterlooWorks is the job posting board and website that students will interact with in order to get a job. This is where you upload your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and other documents (e.g. cover letter(s)), apply for jobs, see when your interviews are scheduled, submit an interview relief form for scheduling conflicts, see and submit your rankings, and see whether you've been matched.

You have 50 applications per round. I highly suggest using all of them for at least the main rounds (first two) and the first week of continous. After that the quality of jobs being posted drops dramatically.

Jobs being posted are usually overwhelmingly software and there are thousands of postings. The level of experience for the job doesn't really matter (employers are lazy and just put all of junior, intermediate, senior for their posting). Make sure to filter by "For your program", and then you can continue filtering (e.g. by keyword).

Don't be too picky and/or set too high of a goal. For first co-op you want something like automated QA or webdev, and getting software development is really good. Avoid unrelated jobs and jobs that won't give you experience (e.g. IT, manual QA, summer camp counselor, etc.). In future terms, you can branch out to jobs that really interest you.

Hardware jobs are limited and generally upper years get them.

# Resume

A good r&eacute;sum&eacute; gets you to the interview.

# Cover Letter

Generally in tech/engineering, cover letters are not really a thing. However, some job postings will require them anyway. Generic cover letters are worse than submitting a completely blank page or your r&eacute;sum&eacute; as your cover letter.

If you want to write a cover letter, [be genuine](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/kxq90h/cover_letter_advice_for_tech_work/). A few sentences is all you need. However, you can go in-depth if you really think your past experience is exceptionally suited to the job.

# Interview

## Behavioural

WIP.

["Could you tell me about a time you [resolved a conflict peacefully] with a teammate?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDoH15ylAeo)

## Technical

WIP.

Leetcode, etc.

# External

Nothing is stopping you from applying to jobs externally, but it's a lot more difficult. This is why WaterlooWorks is a huge advantage.

# Courses on Co-op

WIP.

You can take courses on co-op. You pay extra monies for it.

# PD

Pain.

# Conclusion

The important information to take away is to know how to apply to jobs for co-op and work on getting an offer. However, co-op is not the only part of the first year experience. I will discuss the next topic in the next post.
