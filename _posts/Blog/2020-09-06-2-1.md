This is part of a 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo. In this series, I cover student housing, courses, and other administrative tasks. I will refer to the incoming student as "you".

Today's topic will be on student housing. After accepting and satisfying UW's conditional offer of admission, you will need some place to live. I will discuss two options: on-campus and off-campus, and the advantages and disadvantages of both.

# On-Campus (Residence)

On-campus [residence](https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/) requires a $500 deposit, which will be deducted from your final residence fee. You will have the chance to rank your choice of residence, and mention roommates you would like to room with. UW charges 4 months upfront.

The advantages of residence are:

* A guaranteed place to stay.
* It is relatively close to campus.
* It is housing with other first years, so it is easy to make friends/study groups.
* Parts of the residence that are not student rooms are kept clean by staff.
* It is close to a cafeteria in case you do not want to cook.

The disadvantages of residence are:

* It is expensive, costing over $800 per month.
* An additional expensive meal plan may be required in some residences.

## Residence Specifics

There are three groups of residence buildings:

* UW Place (the south group of residence buildings)
* V1, REV, MKV (the group of residence buildings northwest of Ring Road)
* CLV (the north group of residence buildings)

Additionally, there are the college residences such as St. Jerome's.

Confusingly, UWP refers to two locations:

* The south group of residence buildings.
* An actual building itself (in the aforementioned group).

UW Place (the group) is closest to the engineering buildings (and E7 in particular for ECE students). V1, REV, MKV is not too bad (a bit of extra walk but closer to MC which may be of interest to math students). CLV is far and mostly caters to upper years and grad students (particularly those with families). The college residences are also far but pretty good from what I hear.

I lived in CMH, which is the most modern residence in UW Place (the group) so it was pretty nice and it has air conditioning (excellent for the summer). However, it requires a meal plan.

# Off-Campus

Off-campus housing can be found through sites such as Facebook groups and Kijiji. However, demand for housing is very high in the fall term, and so 4-month sublets will be very expensive and disappear immediately. One-year leases are easier to sign for fall term, but have to be done several months in advance (I signed my lease at the end of January for September). Otherwise advertisements for sublets start a couple of months before the start of the next term as students get co-op offers.

Make sure to know your [tenant](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/hgm2vc/psa_know_your_tenant_rights_this_is_the_time_of/) legal [rights](https://www.ontario.ca/page/renting-ontario-your-rights) as some landlords overstep their bounds (massive deposits, failure to provide maintenance, cleaning fees). The UW subreddit has a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/wiki/index#wiki_off-campus_housing) to off-campus housing but it is a bit out of date. You can also search for posts of previous students' landlords.

The advantages are:

* It might be less expensive depending on location and amenities.
* You have more flexibility depending on need as there are many places to choose from. For example, bedroom size, ensuite bathroom, kitchen and common area, etc.
* There are less restrictions than residence.

The disadvantages are:

* You have to search through postings.
* It is (possibly) further from campus.
* There may not be other first years to interact with.
* It is possible to have bad management/landlord. For example, illegal deposits, unaddressed maintenance problems.
* You will have to spend time and energy cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping (or just get takeout/delivery every day).

## Landlord Specifics

Here is a list of landlords that aren't complete scum:

* Waterloo Off Campus Housing (WOCH) (excellent, would rent from again)
* BK Rents (kind of sketchy but reasonably decent)
* WCRI (it's cooperative housing so basically like residence but off-campus and *really* close to E7)

Independent landlords are hit and miss.

# Packing List

Here is a possible list of things to bring. It is not exhaustive. Omit or include extra items at your own discretion. Also, if you forget to bring something, you can always have it shipped/buy it later.

# Conclusion

As usual, for both on-campus and off-campus, you will most likely have to deal with roommates, and there is a possibility of getting bad ones. Clear communication is an important factor in maintaining house harmony.

The important information to take away is that there are advantages and disadvantages to both on-campus and off-campus housing. You must decide which of the advantages and disadvantages are more important, and find, if not ideal, an acceptable location to live. However, student housing is not the only part of first year preparation. I will discuss the next topic in the next post.
