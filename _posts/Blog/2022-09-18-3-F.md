This is a footnote for the series on the first year experience at the University of Waterloo.

Today's topic will be on failure management.

~~Just don't fail ez~~.

# Content

Failing will deal a great amount of [emotional damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsSP-nHjZ0Q). Failing is okay. My first co-op search was a huge failure, yet I'm doing just fine now.

> Many of you are probably feeling a little sad. This is ok. Sadness is a normal human emotion. I encourage you to watch the movie Inside Out - one of the best movies of all time.

So, what happened? Find the cause. What caused that cause? Why did that cause happen? What caused *that* cause?

Adulting is hard. Reality is disappointing. Life is pain. We push through anyway.

> It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.

Also beating yourself up mentally [won't help](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/eld88t/advice_stop_treating_yourself_like_youre_some/). Take action, what needs to be done to avoid the failure next time? What are the lessons learned? If you can't answer that, try asking someone else. Maybe even visit a professional.

# Conclusion

Give me a break, I'm really tired, I just dumped like 2500 words on the previous two footnotes. I'll fix this up later, this post is currently a failure.
