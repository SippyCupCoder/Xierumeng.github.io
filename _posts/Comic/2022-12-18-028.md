[Sedra Student Design Centre Workbays](https://uwaterloo.ca/sedra-student-design-centre/about/workbays).

Join a student design team! Unfortunately, co-ops are unpaid since the students are all volunteers and the design teams can't afford to pay anyone, but it's a decent experience that you can add to your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and you get to spend time around humans your age.
