Also, remember that this is a guide, and everything I write here is only a suggestion. Your resume is your resume and you are free to accept or reject any suggestions/feedback.

# General

These are the basics.

> An office. On a desk, a stack of resumes from hopeful applicants. The employer sitting behind said desk starts its work on screening potential interview candidates by picking up half the stack and tossing it into the recycling bin. "I don't hire unlucky people," it states, before looking over the first survivor.

Employers will spend between 15 and 60 seconds looking at your resume, looking at possibly hundreds of them over several days. Therefore, it is critical to convey your eligibility in this extremely short period by having a well-organized resume.

* Length - The length of your resume should be at most one page. If you find yourself running out of space, you should remove content or re-arrange formatting and layout.
* Consistency - Inconsistent formatting will throw the employer off (e.g. if some points have periods at the end while others don't).
* Professional - Your resume should be professional. This means no spelling or grammar mistakes, no vulgarity, etc. It should not be in first person.
* Images - There should be no images (other than perhaps icons).

## Layout

* Columns - I prefer one column layouts over two column layouts, because when I look at two column layouts I'm not sure where to look which is very distracting. Automated scanning systems will also most likely screw up on two column layouts.
* Margins - I recommend margins of 15 mm to 25 mm.
* Spacing - Make sure the spacing between lines is good.
* Separation - Make sure each section and sub-section are properly separated.
* Placement - Order your sub-sections by importance, not chronologically. A good older project should be higher than a mediocre new project.

## Font

* Type - I prefer sans-serif fonts because they have less clutter. You should avoid monospaced fonts or fonts that are similar to monospaced fonts.
* Size - Don't make it too small.
* Colour - Some colour adds personality to your resume. However, make sure that it will appear alright if converted to greyscale (most likely through a printer). Also make sure colouring is consistent. I'm not a fan of multiple colours on a single line.
